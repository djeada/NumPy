<h1>Joining and splitting arrays</h1>

* Stacking is the process of joining a sequence of identical-dimension arrays around a new axis.
The axis parameter determines the position of the new axis in the result's dimensions.

* Concatenating refers to joining a sequence of arrays along an existing axis. 
* Appending means adding values along the specified axis at the end of the array.
* Spliting is the process of breaking an array into sub-arrays of identical size.
