<h1>About Numpy</h1>
Numpy stands for Numerical Python.

It is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algerba, fourer transform and matrices.

It is an open source project.

Efficient for scientific computation.

I highly recommend to read this <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/numpy-illustrated-the-visual-guide-to-numpy-3b1d4976de1d">article</a>. 

<h1>Creating an array</h1>

```Python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr)
print(type(arr))
```

Expected output

```
[1 2 3 4]
<class 'numpy.ndarrray'>
```

Ndarray provides a lot of useful functions.
